# PKGBUILD

A collection of Arch Linux PKGBUILD's, some of which I [maintain on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?SeB=m&K=tlvince).

[Some packages](https://github.com/tlvince/pkgbuild/issues/5) are auto-updated using [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/user-stories/maintaining-aur-packages-with-renovate/).
